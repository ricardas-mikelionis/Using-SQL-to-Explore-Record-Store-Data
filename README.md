# Using SQL to explore Record Store Data

In this project I explore business data of a record store using SQL. And try to answer questions such as:
 - The most profitable Genre of music
 - Which employee has the best sales performance
 - How many sales, did customers from different countried generate
 - Is it worth it to move away from album sales in favor of singles sales
